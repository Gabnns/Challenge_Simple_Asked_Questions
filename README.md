# Simple Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Creating a simple FAQ page to test HTML and CSS syntax and improve my web development skills. Starting with HTML working with text, links and lists.

### Goals
The objectives of this project are:

Understand the basics of HTML and CSS syntax
Learn how to structure and style a web page using HTML and CSS
Practice creating and formatting text content
Practice creating and styling headings, paragraphs, and lists
Practice creating and styling links
Practice creating and styling a simple FAQ layout

### Requirements
Create a web page that displays frequently asked questions and their corresponding answers. The page should have the following features:

A heading that describes the purpose of the page (e.g., "Frequently Asked Questions")
A list of questions, each followed by its corresponding answer
The links should be clickable and navigatable with the tab key
The layout should be clean and visually appealing, with appropriate spacing and typography

### Tech Stack
For this project, it is recommended to use only HTML and CSS to create the web page. There are no specific requirements for choosing HTML and CSS frameworks or libraries. It is recommended to use vanilla HTML and CSS for this project, but you can also choose to use popular frameworks like Tailwind CSS if you prefer. In my case, I used the famous CSS processor, Sass.
